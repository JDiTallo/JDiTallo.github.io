                            From my German classes, I really would not be the same person today with 
                            learning so much about not only the German language but also so much of another culture. 
                            In German club, I explored various fun 
                            aspects of Germany such as creating Apfelpuppen (Apple Dolls) 
                            and experiencing Kaffee Klatsch, 
                            a traditional coffee gathering in which I had many conversations 
                            with friends.

                            In German class, I also got to learn about German culture and did many fun activities 
                            revolving around topics like Handball, cultural stories, renting an apartment, German train stations, and many more. 
                            I also gained insight into the cultural differences between Germany and the United States, such as the 
                            different gestures and lifestyles each culture has.
