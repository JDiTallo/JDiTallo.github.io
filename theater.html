                    <h2>Theater</h2>

                    <p>
                        After joining theater in my sophomore year, I felt like I had immersed myself in a new world. 
                        During my time, I had a lot of fun and made many friends along the way. I have played in many roles:
                    </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>The Motorist in "Clue"</li>

                            <li>Sigmund Freud in "Snew White"</li>

                            <li>Eugene in "No Horse Town"</li>

                            <li>Eugeus in "A Midsummer's Night Dream"</li>

                            <li>The Godfather in "The Taming of the Shoe"</li>

                            <li>Dr. William Chumley in "Harvey"</li>

                            <li>Major Metcalf in "The Mousetrap" by Agatha Christie</li>

                        </ol>

                    <p>
                        From the various tasks of theater, such as memorizing lines and acting, 
                        I have developed a great amount of self-confidence in myself.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I was then able to collaborate with supportive friends; the camaraderie during those times inspired 
                        memories I will never forget. My friend and fellow actor, Daniel Breslin, 
                        once told everyone during warm-ups to grasp our hands in front of ourselves. 
                        He says that represents our memories in theater. 
                        Daniel then told us to open our hands, letting the moments we had with each other go, 
                        because it never lasts forever. As such, he says we should always appreciate the present moment. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As such, he says we should always appreciate the present moment. 
                        I still think about that anecdote, because he is right, the present should be appreciated.
                         While simple and a bit cliche, 
                         I’m glad to have had the opportunity to work with everyone who participated in theater, 
                         as all made each show a little bit special. 
                    </p>
